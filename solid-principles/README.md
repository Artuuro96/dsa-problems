# SOLID PRINCIPLES

This folder contains an explanation with practical examples for knowing how to apply SOLID principles and what each one is about

### ➡️  Single Responsibility:
> One class or entity should have only one purpose.[Single Reponsability Example](./single-responsibility.ts)

### ➡️  Open/Close:
> Classes or methods should be open for extension but close for modifications [Open - Close Example](open-closed.ts)

### ➡️  Liskov Substitution:
> This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class [Liskov Substitution Example](./liskov-substitution.ts)

### ➡️  Interface Segregation: 
> Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones [Interface Segregation Example](./interface-segregation.ts)

### ➡️  Dependency Inversion: 
> Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions [Dependency Inversion Example](./dependency-inversion.ts)
